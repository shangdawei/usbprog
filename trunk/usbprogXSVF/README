XSVF USB Player (usbprogXSVF)

by Sven Luetkemeier, sven@sl-ware.de, 2007

XSVF files are a standard to describe arbitrary JTAG operations. 
This firmware enables usbprog to "play" such files, that means 
to execute the JTAG operations contained in the XSVF file via 
the usbprog adapter. That way CPLDs, FPGAs, or JTAG-enabled 
microcontrollers can be programmed, erased, tested etc. The only 
need is a software that can produce XSVF files for the target device.

Status

The XSVF player is functional if all single XSVF instructions are 
not bigger than 64 bytes. Tested under Linux 
(openSUSE 10.3 x86_64, Debian/Sarge) with a Xilinx XC9572 CPLD and an XC9572XL CPLD.
