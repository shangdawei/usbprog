<h2>Xilinx USB JTAG Programming</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This page describes xup, a 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU GPL</a> utility for
programming Xilinx FPGA/CPLD/PROM devices via 
Xilinx's USB JTAG programmer.

There are
<a href="http://whats.all.this.brouhaha.com/?p=149">several</a> 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.arch.fpga/browse_thread/thread/c945923560a4f980/3b962579bdaa3d5d">reasons</a> to use xup instead of Xilinx's proprietary software,
especially when running Linux. 
</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>
2006-08-19: xup-0.0.2 - <b>CPLD updated to fix possible electrical contention with iMPACT</b>.
Upgrade highly recommended.
<br/>
2006-05-28: xup-0.0.1 - initial release.
</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=HW-SPAR3E-SK-US">Spartan3E Starter Kit</a> is xup's only supported hardware platform. Its integrated programming hardware consists of a
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/portal/server.pt?space=CommunityPage&amp;control=SetCommunity&amp;CommunityID=209&amp;PageID=259&amp;fid=14&amp;rpn=CY7C68013A">cy7c68013a-100axc</a> EZ-USB and a XC2C256-VQ100-6C CPLD.
</p>
<p>
Mysteriously, the starter kit's
<a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards/files/s3e_starter_schematic.pdf">schematics</a>
exclude this USB programming hardware. The programmer's electrical connectivity was
reverse engineered to implement xup.
</p>
<p>
The standalone
<a href="http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?sGlobalNavPick=PRODUCTS&amp;sSecondaryNavPick=Design+Tools&amp;key=HW-USB">Xilinx Platform Cable USB</a> is unsupported and untested. Since its hardware is presumably very similar, it may be usable as-is or with some minor hacking.
</p>
<h3>CY7C68013A EZ-USB</h3>
<p>
The EZ-USB contains an 8051 microcontroller. The firmware used with iMPACT is proprietary,
and is therefore not used with xup.
A replacement firmware has been written in C, allowing the USB host to bit-bang the
XC2C256's JTAG port, as well as the system JTAG port connnected to the Starter Kit's
XC3S500E FPGA, XCF04S PROM, and XC2C64 CPLD.
</p>
<p>
xup does not modify the I2C EEPROM containing the programmer's USB ID
(and possibly iMPACT firmware). The xup utilities reload the EZ-USB firmware
over USB at startup.
</p>
<h3>XC2C256</h3>
<p>
The CPLD image used with iMPACT is proprietary, and is therefore not used with xup.
A simple replacement CPLD image has been created to connect several EZ-USB
I/Os to the system's JTAG signals. Prior to accessing the system's JTAG,
this CPLD image must first be downloaded using XSVF JTAG playback.
</p>
<h3>XSVF Playback</h3>
<p>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.xilinx.com/pub/swhelp/cpld/eisp_pc.zip">XSVF Playback software</a>
from <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/bvdocs/appnotes/xapp058.pdf">XAPP058</a> has been modified 
to work with xup's EZ-USB firmware. This XSVF player is used to download xup's
XC2C256 CPLD image, and can also be used to program devices on the system JTAG chain.
</p>
<h3>XC3SProg</h3>
<p>
Andrew Roger's <a href="http://www.rogerstech.force9.co.uk/xc3sprog/">xc3sprog</a>
has been modified to work with xup's firmware + CPLD. This modified version can program
the Starter Kit's XC3S500E FPGA directly from a .bit file.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/">libusb</a> is used for all USB device access. As a result,
no kernel modules are required on the development workstation. Furthermore, root access is not required.
Under Linux, the user must merely have access to the appropriate /proc/bus/usb/BUS/DEV file
(typically granted by chown'ing it). The BUS and DEV numbers in the filename can be
extracted from lsusb's output.
</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>
Q: Will xup lock out the Xilinx tools forever, or can iMPACT successfully reconfigure the
JTAG hardware to replace xup?
<br/>
A: iMPACT will simply redownload its EZ-USB + CPLD images over xup's, as if it were upgrading
older iMPACT firmware.  To switch back to xup, redownload the xup CPLD image via XSVF.
The use of different CPLD images is unavoidable unless Xilinx documents the iMPACT CPLD
(or it is reversed).
</p>
<p>
Q: Will xup's xc3sprog detect that the proper CPLD was programmed?
<br/>
A: Not yet. CPLD detection may be added in a future release. Do NOT run xup's xc3sprog unless
the xup CPLD download succeeded. Also, do NOT  mix CPLD and firmware versions from different
versions of xup.
</p>
<p>
Q: Is USB1 supported?
<br/>
A: Currently no. USB1 may be tested in the future but will be extremely slow. Install a USB2 card.
</p>
<p>
Q: AMD64/PPC32/PPC64? BSD?
<br/>
A: Currently untested but should work w/ minor hacking.
</p>
<h3>Future Work</h3>
<p>
Downloading the XC3S500E via xup takes about 8 seconds, making xup about 4X slower than iMPACT
(once started).  The load time is a small price to pay for dodging a
<a href="http://www.jungo.com/windriver.html">proprietary nightmare</a>. And there are
many ways to improve xup's speed. For now, though, they are left as an exercise for the
ambitious reader.
</p>
<p>
The programmer's EZ-USB and XC2C256 are barely utilized with xup, and could implement
a lot of added functionality. One option is to connect the Starter Kit FPGA to USB2
by wiring a few FPGA user I/Os to the EZ-USB and/or CPLD.

</p>
<h3>HOWTO</h3>
<p>
With Debian Sid:
</p>
<pre>
apt-get install libusb-dev
apt-get install sdcc
tar zxvf xup-0.0.2.tar.gz
cd xup-0.0.2
make
# download xup's pre-built programmer CPLD image
# this will take 5-30 minutes
# you only need to do this when installing/upgrading xup,
# or switching between iMPACT and xup
./p -v 4 prog.xsvf
# now build xup's XC3SProg
cd XC3SProg
make
./xc3prog /some/file.bit
