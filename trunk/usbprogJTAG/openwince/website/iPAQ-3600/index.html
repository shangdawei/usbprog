<h1>Fitting a JTAG interface to an iPAQ 3600</h1>
<p><span>
So you couldn't resist messing with your brand new iPAQ, tried to re-flash it and managed to turn it into a brick ?<br>
Now you turn it on and it just sits there, silent, screen blank, just mocking you ?<br>
Do you (think you) have the skills to take delicate, sensitive electronic appliances apart ?<br>
...and solder connections to small contact pads you can barely see with the naked eye ?<br>
...and put them back together ?<br>
<br>
If the answer to all of the above it yes, never fear, help is here [cue cheesy music]<br>
</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>First of all, disassemble the iPAQ and remove the main board. If you wish, desolder the speaker cables. </span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/1.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Next turn the board with the CPU facing up. The CPU is the square object located next to the E28F640J3A120 FLASH chips as seen below. It is covered with a metallic shield.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/2.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Take a closer look at the bottom edge of the CPU and locate the test points, ordered left to right as TP3 (TDO), TP2 (TDI) and TP5 (TRST)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/3.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Carefully solder some suitable wires to the test points.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/4.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Find a good ground connection and solder a wire to it too.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/5.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Turn the board over and locate the 3.686Mhz crystal.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/6.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Just above it, you’ll find test points TP1 (TCK) and TP4 (TMS)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/7.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Solder some suitable wire to these test points too.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/8.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Further up on the same side of the board is a metal can crystal, located just below the Atmel AT90LS8535 microcontroller.<br>This is the VCC connection, so solder a wire to the pad shown below.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/9.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Eventually you end up with a bunch of wires hanging loose of the iPAQ board.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/A.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>You could, if desired, solder a berg strip or other suitable connector for easy attachment to the JTAG board.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/B.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t have a JTAG adapter, Xilinx publishes the <a href="http://axl.freeyellow.com/iPAQ/images/xilinx-DLC5-pp2jtag.pdf">schematic</a> of a PC parallel port to JTAG adapter that you can easily build yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>I personally ended up using the simplest interface of all, about five resistors (any value 100 - 330 ohm should do) arranged as follows:<br>
<img src="images/interface.png"></span></p>
<p><span>
Finally you need some spiffy software to do the programming. I used <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=52603&release_id=133435">jtag-0.2.1</a> which I set up under <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> on my Windows XP system.<br>
I won't go into the software setup here, however jtag-0.2.1 needs a couple of small mods before it can program the iPAQ.<br>
Download <a href="flash.c">flash.c</a> and <a href="sa1110.c">sa1110.c</a> and replace the corresponding files in jtag-0.2.1 source tree before compiling.
</span></p>
<h1>Happy Flashing</h1>

<p><span>Additional pictures of the final JTAG connector permanently fitted to my development iPAQ.<br>
These were taken after desoldering the metal shield covers off the CPU and DRAM.</span></p>
<p><span>Pink: TDO, Brown: TDI, Red: TRST, Blue: GND</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/10.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Orange: TCK, Yellow: TMS</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/11.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Green: VCC</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/12.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>All cables soldered.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/13.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Final assembly. I chose to pull the cables out of the stylus hole as anywhere at the bottom interferes with the docking station seating.<br>
There's no other suitable hole and I wasn't about to drill one :)<br>
This means the stylus will not plug in (small sacrifice) but on the plus side, the casing around the stylus hole, clamps the wires in place so you can't accidentally tug on them too hard.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="images/14.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>Below is an actual session programming a bootloader into a fully erased iPAQ.</span></p>
